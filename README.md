# Omnifood

## Overview

This is the start of my attempt at cloning the omnifood.dev website. The website I am cloning is by Jonas Schmedtmann, produced for one of his HTML / CSS courses -- which I am not enrolled in.

This will be a **completely independent effort** on my part. Using the publicly-available image assets found on the site, I am recreating his design using vanilla HTML, SCSS, and probably a tiny bit of JavaScript. I may inspect an element here and there to get some font sizes and spacing, but that's about it.

If I am pleased with the results, I may even find a way to turn it into a fullstack web app -- at which point I may consider a React version.

## Goals

The goal of this clone project is to practice responsive website design without the burden of coming up with assets, color scheme, copy, etc, all on my own. I hope to solidify a SCSS-based, mobile-first development workflow that I have settled on recently.
